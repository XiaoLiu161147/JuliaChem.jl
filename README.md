# Welcome to JuliaChem!
JuliaChem is an electronic structure theory program written in Julia, designed to combine
Julia's dynamic and interactive nature with its high-performance capabilities to offer users the best of both worlds for quantum chemistry computations.

# Documentation
JuliaChem uses the Documenter.jl package to allow for the generation of its
documentation. Much of the information regarding JuliChem, its usage, and its
inner workings is contained within the documentation. The documentation is
generated by going into the docs/ directory and running

julia make_user.jl

in the shell.
