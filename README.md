# Welcome to JuliChem!
JuliChem is an electronic structure theory program written in Julia, designed to combine
Julia's dynamic and interactive nature with its high-performance capabilities to offer users the best of both worlds for quantum chemistry computations.

# Documentation
JuliChem uses the Documenter.jl package to allow for the generation of its
documentation. Much of the information regarding JuliChem, its usage, and its
inner workings is contained within the documentation. The documentation is
generated by going into the docs/ directory and running

julia make_xxx.jl

in the shell, where make_xxx can refer to one of two make scripts:
1. make_user.jl returns information about the usage of JuliChem, the different
modules that exist for the user within JuliChem, and the flags that can be set
in a JuliChem input file. This is the recommended make script for users of JuliChem.

2. make_dev.jl returns information about all modules in JuliChem, and all functions
that exist for each module. This effectively returns documentation about every
component of the code itself, and is thus the recommended make script for JuliChem
developers.
